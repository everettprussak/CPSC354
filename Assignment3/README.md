# Critical Apprasial
## Information about Part 1:
### For part 1, I changed the name of the function "is_empty" to "isEmpty". I was getting an error due to the underscore, so I decided that this was the best name change for it. All of the other functions work as you would expect. isEmpty will give a 1 if the list is empty, and a 0 if the list is not empty. Fib will calculate the fibonacci of a number, assuming that that number is a positive whole number. length will calculate the length of a list. even will return 1 if the list is even, and 0 if it is not. An empty is list will be considered "not even" so a 0 will be returned. Append will append the second list to the back of the first list. reverse will reverse the list. Weave will weave a list in order, IF the lists are already in order. If they are not in order, and weave is used, the lists will be combined, but not in order and not similar to just appending to the end.
